I have been working at [Banyan Intelligence](https://www.linkedin.com/company/banyan-intelligence/posts/?feedView=all), a startup incubated at IISc, Bangalore, for the past two years  following my graduation from the [Indian Institute of Science](https://iisc.ac.in/) (IISc), where I pursued a Masters in Research at the Department of [Electrical Communication Engineering](https://ece.iisc.ac.in/) (ECE). Over the past two years, my role span software development, DevOps, MLOps, and product development. During my role, I have been gaining expertise in building distributed systems to analyze and manage terabytes of data, supporting real-time diagnostics and powering advanced AI applications like Generative AI (GenAI), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and agentic AI. Early in my role, I contributed to the 5G ORAN team, developing xAPPs and rAPPs for intelligent handover (HO) control in multi-UE setups within a near-RT RAN Intelligent Controller.

During my M.Tech. (research) at IISc, I designed ["ROS-QOS-PANEL,"](https://youtu.be/_w7xB8eT8B8), a software tool ensuring network-level Quality of Service (QoS) for ROS2-based middleware in latency-sensitive robotic applications over Wi-Fi networks. My research focused on addressing QoS bottlenecks in latency-critical robotic applications over wireless networks, with an emphasis on IP and MAC layer QoS over Wi-Fi. I delved into the Linux kernel networking stack and the Network Interface Card (NIC) to identify and resolve issues like traffic congestion at the kernel memory buffer. As an extension of this work, as a part of my thesis I suggested the potential for further advancements, including dynamic scheduling, eBPF for adaptive QoS, and multi-robot QoS management, which could significantly enhance the solution's performance over Wi-Fi and cellular LTE/5G networks.

Before my master’s, I worked as a Project Assistant on the Government of India’s 5G TestBed project at IISc, where I developed and benchmarked V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) communication systems using Wi-Fi and LTE. Notable achievements included designing a custom MAC scheduler, achieving low-latency communication for vehicular and drone control, and enabling remote driving and emergency braking with smart handover algorithms. We successfully showcased remote driving of Unmanned vehicle over a campus wide LTE-Advanced Setup. During my tenure, I also explored technologies like 802.11p (DSRC) for V2X communication. 

As an undergraduate, I contributed to the campus nanosatellite development project through my final year project, designing an AIS receiver for the STUDSAT-2 lab earning the best project award from the department of ECE, NMIT, Bangalore. 

I am broadly interested in communication networks involving low-latency communication, Operating Systems, distributed systems, and AI-driven solutions, bridging academia and industry to address cutting-edge challenges.
