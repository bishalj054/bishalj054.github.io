I have been working at Banyan Intelligence [https://www.linkedin.com/company/banyan-intelligence/posts/?feedView=all], a startup incubated at IISc [https://iisc.ac.in/] Bangalore, for the past two years after graduating from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), where I pursued a Masters in Research at the Department of Electrical Communication Engineering [https://ece.iisc.ac.in/] (ECE). At Banyan Intelligence, my role spans software development, DevOps, and client and product research. I am also involved with 5G ORAN. During my time at IISc, my research focused on designing a ROS2-based scheduler for real-time data-flows in messaging middleware to ensure Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees.
