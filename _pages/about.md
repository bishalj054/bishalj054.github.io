I have been working at [Banyan Intelligence](https://www.linkedin.com/company/banyan-intelligence/posts/?feedView=all), a startup incubated at IISc, Bangalore, for the past two years after graduating from the [Indian Institute of Science](https://iisc.ac.in/) (IISc), where I pursued a Masters in Research at the Department of [Electrical Communication Engineering](https://ece.iisc.ac.in/) (ECE). At Banyan, my role spans software development, DevOps, MLOps and product development. We focus on building distributed systems for analyzing and managing terabytes of data to support real-time analysis, debugging, and advanced applications in Generative AI (GenAI), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and agentic AI. During my initial days at Banyan, I worked to the 5G ORAN team, specifically focusing on xAPPs and rAPPs for Intelligent HO control in a multi UE setup in a near-RT RAN Intelligent Controller.

During my M.Tech. (research) at IISc, I designed ["ROS-QOS-PANEL,"](https://youtu.be/_w7xB8eT8B8) a software solution to ensure network-level Quality of Service (QoS) for ROS2-based messaging middleware. My research focused on addressing QoS bottlenecks in latency-critical robotic applications over wireless networks, with an emphasis on IP and MAC layer QoS over Wi-Fi. I explored the Linux kernel networking stack and the Network Interface Card (NIC) to identify and resolve issues like traffic congestion at the kernel memory buffer. As an extension of this work, I identified the potential for further advancements, including dynamic scheduling, eBPF for adaptive QoS, and multi-robot QoS management, which could significantly enhance the solution's performance over Wi-Fi and cellular LTE/5G networks.
